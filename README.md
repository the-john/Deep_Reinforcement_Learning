# Deep_Reinforcement_Learning

This is where I'm going to keep the stuff I assemble while going through the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nano Degree.  

To start, I'm going to keep my collected White Papers here [DRL_White_Papers](https://github.com/the-john/Deep_Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/DL_White_Papers).

I also got the MuJoCo200 Environment running on my computer.  It would appear the MuJoCo has its own language ... something that I'd very much like to dive into.  But, for now, I need to focus on my Reinforcement Learning efforts.  (So much to learn, so little time!)  Documentation on MuJoCo can be found here [MuJoCo_Book](http://www.mujoco.org/book).
